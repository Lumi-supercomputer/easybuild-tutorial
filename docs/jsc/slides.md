### EasyBuild at JSC

* Geared toward *average* user experience
  @ul[list-hide-fragments]
  - Hide lots of indirect software
  - Hierarchy
  - Renaming some modules, lmod tweaks
  @ulend

* Custom mns, toolchains, easyconfigs, easyblocks
  @ul[list-hide-fragments]
  - Maintenance and contribution issue
  - Working hard to remove this where possible

### Leveraging hooks for user support

* Very powerful alternative to customisations
  @ul[list-hide-fragments]
  - Much more automated and flexible
  - Easier to maintain
  @ulend

* Enable user space installations
  @ul[list-hide-fragments]
  - Can be leveraged to *guide* people on how to do this properly

### Upgrading and retiring software

* Provide latest software to new projects by default
  @ul[list-hide-fragments]
  - ***stages*** concept
  - Updates twice per year
  - Encourages users to adopt latest dependencies (performance, bug fixes,...)
  @ulend
* Give indirect access to "retired" software
