# The EasyBuild community

## Brief history

<a href="http://ugent.be/hpc"><img src="../img/ugent_logo.png" style="float:left" width="15%"/></a>

EasyBuild was originally created by the [HPC team at Ghent University (Belgium)](https://www.ugent.be/hpc/en) in 2009.
It was developed in-house for several years, and re-designed a couple of times with the help of summer interns.

Over the years the HPC-UGent team got interested in receiving feedback from
the HPC community on the project, and decided to make it publicly available.

The first public release was in April 2012 (version 0.5), shortly before the project
was [presented at the HEPIX Spring Workshop 2012](https://indico.cern.ch/event/160737/contributions/1407847/).

The first stable version ([EasyBuild v1.0](https://pypi.org/project/easybuild/1.0.0)) was released in November 2012,
during the [SC'12 conference in Salt Lake City](http://sc12.supercomputing.org/), shortly
before it was presented at the [PyHPC 2012 workshop](http://sc12.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail.php-evid=wksp118.html).

Shortly after the public release and a bit of promotion in the HPC community,
other sites starting to use EasyBuild, and actively contribute to it.
Early adopters include the [University of Luxembourg](https://hpc.uni.lu), the [Cyprus Institute](https://www.cyi.ac.cy/),
the [University of Basel](https://scicore.unibas.ch/), and the [Jülich
Supercomputing Centre](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc).

## A worldwide community

Over the years EasyBuild has grown out to a **community project**,
which is used and developed by dozens (hundreds?) of HPC centres and consortia worldwide.

The map below shows from which
cities the [EasyBuild documentation](https://easybuild.readthedocs.io) has
been visited in the last year (June 2019 - June 2020), and how often.
