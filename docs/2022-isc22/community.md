# The EasyBuild community

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/easybuild_group_picture_eum20.png" alt="Group picture at EasyBuild User Meeting 2020" width="800px"/></p>

EasyBuild has grown into a **community project** since it was first released publicy in 2012,
and is used and developed by hundreds of HPC centres and consortia worldwide.

Since 2016, the EasyBuild community has gathered for a yearly [**EasyBuild User Meeting**](https://easybuild.io/eum),
which is an open and highly interactive event that provides a great opportunity to meet fellow EasyBuild users,
developers, and maintainers, and to discuss related topics, learn about new aspects of the tool, and how other HPC
sites leverage it and integrate it with other tools like [Jenkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzW45cfRUMU),
[Ansible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr2udsAjkG0), [CernVM-FS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0j5Shuf2uE),
[ReFrame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN9QwQIrso4) etc.

The map below shows from which
cities the [EasyBuild documentation](https://docs.easybuild.io) has
been visited in the period June 1st 2020 - June 1st 2021, and how often.

### *Getting help*

#### *Documentation*

If you have any questions about EasyBuild, make sure to check the EasyBuild documentation first,
which is available at [**https://docs.easybuild.io**](https://docs.easybuild.io).

It is not unlikely that an answer to your question is available there already.
The [search box](https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/search.html) on the top left may be helpful.

#### GitHub

<a href="http://github.com/easybuilders"><img src="../../img/github_logo.png" style="float:left" width="15%"/></a>

You can open an issue in one of the EasyBuild repositories in [the `easybuilders` GitHub organisation](https://github.com/easybuilders/) to
ask questions, report problems or share suggestions and ideas for additional
improvements.

Please try to post the issue in the most suitable repository. If you are
not sure which repository is most suited just go ahead and open the issue anyway,
the EasyBuild maintainers can move your issue if deemed appropriate.

Also here you can use the search box on the top left, to see if somebody else
has already asked a similar question or reported a similar problem.

#### Mailing list

Feel free to ask any questions or provide feedback via the EasyBuild mailing list
<a href="mailto:easybuild@lists.ugent.be">`easybuild@lists.ugent.be`</a>.

Keep in mind that **you must be subscribed to the mailing list in order to
post messages there!** You can subscribe via [this link](https://lists.ugent.be/wws/subscribe/easybuild).

In 2016-2017 over 1,000 messages were posted to the EasyBuild mailing list.
More recently this has decreased to about 700 messages per year, mostly due
to the EasyBuild Slack channel.

#### Slack

<img src="../../img/slack_logo.png" alt="Slack logo" style="float:left" width="22%"/>

The [EasyBuild Slack](https://easybuild.slack.com/) is a quick and easy way
to get in touch with the EasyBuild community.
Over 450 people have joined it so far, and there is usually somebody awake in there
who may be able to help you out.

**To join the EasyBuild Slack request an invitation via
[https://easybuild-slack.herokuapp.com](https://easybuild-slack.herokuapp.com/).**

If you are not a big fan of Slack, you can also consider joining the `#easybuild`
IRC channel (available on the [Libera IRC network](https://libera.chat)).
A bot relays messages between this IRC channel and the `#general` channel in the EasyBuild Slack.

!!! Note
    A dedicated [`#tutorial-isc22` channel](https://easybuild.slack.com/archives/C03FJCGJ1DF) was created for this tutorial in the EasyBuild Slack.

    If you have any questions that are specific to this tutorial, please post them there!

#### Conference calls

Every other week on Wednesday an EasyBuild conference call is set up to discuss recent
developments, provide an outlook to the next EasyBuild release, and
provide answers to questions that can be raised by the people attending the call.

These conference calls are open to anyone interested in the EasyBuild project,
and have been organised since November 2013.

More information, including the dates and times of the next calls, is available [here](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/wiki/Conference-calls).
