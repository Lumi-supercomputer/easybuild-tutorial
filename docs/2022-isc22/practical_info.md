<p align="center"><a href="https://easybuild.io"><img src="../../img/easybuild_logo_alpha.png" alt="EasyBuild logo" width="300px"/></a></p>

This page explains how you can prepare for the EasyBuild tutorial
that takes place at [ISC'22](https://www.isc-hpc.com/) *(registration required!)*.

## Prepared environment

Tutorial attendees will be able to log in to a prepared environment
where they can follow along with hands-on examples, or solve the
tutorial exercises.

You can create an account for the prepared environment by filling
out the [account form](https://mokey.isc22.learnhpc.eu/auth/signup).
The accounts will _not_ be approved until the day before the event, so
**please remember to keep a record of your username and password**.

Once the account is approved, you will be able to access the system
at [https://isc22.learnhpc.eu/](https://isc22.learnhpc.eu/), or via `ssh`:

    ssh isc22.learnhpc.eu

## Slack

We strongly recommend joining the [#tutorial-isc22](https://easybuild.slack.com/archives/C03FJCGJ1DF)
channel in the [EasyBuild Slack](https://easybuild.slack.com).

In this channel, you can:

* raise questions both during the live tutorial session, and afterwards;
* get help with following the hands-on examples or solving the exercises;

The `#tutorial-isc22` channel will remain available after the live tutorial
session.

You can self-request an invitation to join the EasyBuild Slack via
[https://easybuild.io/join-slack](https://easybuild.io/join-slack).
