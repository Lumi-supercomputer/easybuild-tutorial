You can open an issue in one of the EasyBuild repositories in [the `easybuilders` GitHub organisation](https://github.com/easybuilders/) to
ask questions, report problems or share suggestions and ideas for additional
improvements.

Please try to post the issue in the most suitable repository. If you are
not sure which repository is most suited just go ahead and open the issue anyway,
the EasyBuild maintainers can move your issue if deemed appropriate.

You can also use the search box on the top left to see if somebody else
has already asked a similar question.

The [EasyBuild Slack](https://easybuild.slack.com/) is a quick and easy way
to get in touch with the EasyBuild community.
Over 275 people have joined it so far, and there is usually somebody awake in there
who may be able to help you out.

To join the EasyBuild Slack, request an invitation via [this link](https://easybuild-slack.herokuapp.com/).

If you are not a big fan of Slack, you can also consider joining the `#easybuild`
IRC channel (available on the [Freenode IRC network](https://freenode.net/)).
A bot relays messages between this IRC channel and the `#general` channel in the EasyBuild Slack.

## Conference calls

Every other week on Wednesday an EasyBuild conference call is set up to discuss recent
developments, provide an outlook to the next EasyBuild release, and
provide answers to questions that can be raised by the people attending the call.

These conference calls are open to anyone interested in the EasyBuild project.

More information, including the dates and times of the next calls, is available [here](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/wiki/Conference-calls).
